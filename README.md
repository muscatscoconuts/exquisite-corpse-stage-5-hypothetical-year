## Briefs for each stage

### ðŸ”´ Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### ðŸŸ¡ Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### ðŸŸ¢ Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### ðŸ”µ Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### ðŸŸ£ Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

Welcome to this hypothetical little universe which follows a hypothetical sequence of hypothetical seasons.

I am really interested in the naturally occuring types of time - and how we tend to forget about this mesasurment of time in the overbearing presence of the man-made clock. In comparison to the ticking hands of the mechanical timepiece, the natural world around us keeps track of time in a very different way, following and changing with the path of the sun in a perpertual and fairly predictable loop.

I wanted to create a hypothetical natural loop that follows similar seasonal cycles to Earth, but on a smaller scale. There are 26 images in the changing cycle, which each represent about 14 days passing. the loop cycles through 365 days worth of seasonal changes in 26 seconds.

To create the first image I began by asking generative AI to process one single "summer" landscape. I wanted it to be as broad a promt as possible so that there would be some room for the AI to essentially make choices about what it wanted to present. Then I went into photoshop with the image and continiued to apply new generative AI fill overtop each new image and add prompts to areas such as "winter snowstorm sky" "dry barren desert" "spring flowers" "wetlands" etc. The outcome was a 26 step transformation of a single AI generated image of what it percieves as natural life. 

It took some time to blend each new image into the next and there was a lot of trial and error with what the generative fill would create. I wanted the flow of time to have some logic to it which is why it roughly follows Earth's seasonal changes.

The cycle of nature always evokes a sense of wonder, with each season of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, even each day, presenting distinctly different landscapes. Yet, we are often swept away by the torrent of time, engulfed in the ceaseless pursuits of learning and work, finding it challenging to quiet our minds and appreciate the wonders of nature. Therefore, building upon the evolving natural images created by Odette, I have integrated a time selection feature. By choosing a desired time point, the system will automatically display the corresponding natural scenery, granting us the opportunity to serenely admire the natural beauty we long for. In this way, we can momentarily detach from the busyness of reality, experiencing the slow flow of time within nature.

The program offsets the number of days in the past to match the seasonal scenery in the Northern Hemisphere.

*I started off reading an article for research.  I wanted to make images move with the input of a sound file.  This is the sound file I downloaded from https://nz.7digital.com/download/842515579. 
I worked for 3 hours trying to be successful but could not figure out how to make the idea work.

I went back to the Stage 2 idea to redevelop my plan.  I kept two of the images to respond to and deleted all of the coding.  I re-watched the FA205 tutorial on the Visualization of Data Sets but did not want to work from the same CVS file.  I found a coding video teaching a lesson on Quicksort Visualization on YouTube from The Coding Train.  It uses an array to write a function to sort data quickly.  The function starts with random values and sorts all the data until everything is in place to how you decide you want to sort it. A partition is created as a pivot to sort data from one side to the other until it is complete. It goes to the left or right of the pivot point until all data is where it needs to be.  The scan tool goes through the data from left to right, over and over.  

I used ChatGPT to play with adding the images to the background; however, I could not load the images.  

I responded to Stage 2 using the two images as inspiration.  The images are horizontal land spaces with colours of blue and orange.  My data starts horizontally and becomes a vertical mountain of lines to represent order.  The environment versus the computed generated image of the fake landscape. 

My issue with coding and art is that I find it very difficult to act on the ideas I have in my head.  Also, time does not seem to equal the output of results.  Something that took 7 hours looks like 30 minutes of work.  I find the creative process of coding frustrating.

*I wanted to put a playful spin on this stage three sketch, hearing â€˜gameâ€™ I instantly thought of some sort of fun. The combination of orange and blue from the previous stage really stood out to me, so I drew from these colours and the mountain shape made by the graphs. I have created a short text based game called â€˜Orange Mountainâ€™. The user is asked to help find lost oranges as they travel and overcome various obstacles on the mountain.
I digitally drew the backgrounds I used in this sketch (except for the oranges- I downloaded them from the internet). I used a retro computer font to get that old school computer game feel. 
It took a bit of trial and error to work out a good way to make the game progress smoothly. I ended up using â€˜setTimeoutâ€™ and separate functions to make the text change in each section.*

The images Emma created for the previous stage were so beautiful, so I decided to create a constantly active mountain scene. The white dots represent the people trying and failing to climb the mountain to find the lost oranges. Their tireless search persists through a day and night cycle, yet they never manage to reach the oranges. I used object classes that we learnt in workshops to create the climbers and the oranges,and with a lot of tweaking I was able to adjust the climbers so that once they reached a certain way up the mountain, they would return back to the bottom again to create a perpetual cycle. I was able to add the blue nighttime tint my self, but i asked chatGPT for help in making the filter come on and off the background - i initially wanted it to fade in and out but i couldnt figure out how to make it work without turning the image funny colours at other points, so i went for a more simple tint on and off using an if statement, and some other variables for time o that it would be 40 seconds on, 40 seconds off. It is amazing to compare this stage of the project to what it began as - they are so different! I really enjoyed remixing Emma's work.
